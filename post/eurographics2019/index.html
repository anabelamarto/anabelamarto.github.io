Very well known among computer graphics comunity as a great opportunity to share, learn and explore the latest works and ideas, Eurographics 2019 edition was also the right event to find some interesting topics to bridge with SensiMAR prototype.</p><p></p><p>SensiMAR prototype intends to study a multisensory approach among cultural heritage and it will embrace several topics. My participation in Eurographics 2019, as a student volunteer, has brought several benefits for my research and, of course, for my personal experience.</p><h2 id=the-overall-conference>The overall Conference</h2><p>It matters to refer that this was my first time attending to Eurographics conference. As any other big conferences, there are several sessions happening at the same time. However, the topics that are being presented among the several sessions do not overlap each other, so I never felt the will to be in two different rooms at the same time, which was great. As a student volunteer, of course that I had some duties that didn&rsquo;t allow me to attend to every session I wanted, but I am very satisfied in the overall experience and acquired knowledge.</p><p>The program included several types of sessions, sucha as Full Papers Presenations, Short Papers Presenations, Tutorials, Think Tank Presenations, Keynote Speakers, Workshops, among many others.</p><p>My collaboratioon in this conference, as a student volunteer, was extremelly fullfilling and, among acquirements, it was useful to make some bridging points regarding to the SensiMAR study.</p><h2 id=bridging-some-topics-to-sensimar>Bridging some topics to SensiMAR</h2><p>Taking the risk of having missed some other interesting topics that could have been talked among other sessions - as a studen volunteer I had some duties which included some work out of the sessions -, this topic presents some insights tht can be usefull for the conception of SensiMAR prototype.</p><h3 id=thinkn-tank-session>Thinkn Tank session</h3><p>One of the Thinkn Tank session, entitled &ldquo;The future of avatar-human interaction in VR, AR and mixed reality applications&rdquo; triggered some possible connections for the SensiMAR. Among this session, conducted by Nuria Pelechano, several virtual humanoids studies were presented and interesting results were here presented by herself, Julien Pettré, Michael Neff, and by Yiorgos Chrysanthou.</p><p>Not only focusing on avatar&rsquo;s virtual representation, their behaviour and responses to the environment was the main issue discussed topic. Having immersion, presence, and social presence in VR and AR as target, differentissues and limitations were also highlightd, opening and calling the attention for further research.</p><p>Focusing on the presentation made by Yiorgos Chrysanthou, who invited us to think about the the modelling process, behaviour and animation, and rendering processes among AR solutions. He also invited us to think about ethical issues regarding to the VR and AR usage. Namely, asking if we could be isolate further users from real humans - and what consequences this could have. This also can lead to a very commonly referred topic related to emotional attachment to virtual characters. Consequently, depending on the level of envolvment that people could get into these avatars, if these &ldquo;friendships&rdquo; could lead to disclosure of personal information.</p><h3 id=industrial-track>Industrial Track</h3><p>Inm the industrial track, some companies presented their actual solutions applying VR and AR among several fields. Among these, cultural heritage was specially focused by Giorgio Genta, from EET solutions (<a href=http://ettsolutions.com/ target=_blank>website here</a> ), which presented virtual, mixed and augmented reality applications for cultural heritage. Giorgio showed us their seccessful AR mobile solution applied in Museo dell&rsquo;Ara Pacis (Rome), using Samsung Gear VR wearable. Among their visit, visitants can observe the painted versions of the actual exhibited panels (figure x).</p><p><img src=/img/ea2019/ett.jpg alt="Museo dell'Ara Pacis (Rome)" width=100%></p><h2 id=electronic-theatre>Electronic Theatre</h2><p>Electronic Theatre, a showcase animated feature and short films, scientific visualization, visual effects, making-of shorts of the latest blockbusters, real-time graphics, game excerpts, among others. Each year, the SIGGRAPH Computer Animation Festival Jury reviews films from the past 12 months and selects the best work, presented in the Electronic Theater on 9<sup>th</sup> of May.</p></div><div class="post__tags tags clearfix"><svg class="icon icon-tag" width="16" height="16" viewBox="0 0 16 16"><path d="M16 9.5c0 .373-.24.74-.5 1l-5 5c-.275.26-.634.5-1 .5-.373.0-.74-.24-1-.5L1 8a2.853 2.853.0 0 1-.7-1C.113 6.55.0 5.973.0 5.6V1.4C0 1.034.134.669.401.401.67.134 1.034.0 1.4.0h4.2c.373.0.95.113 1.4.3.45.187.732.432 1 .7l7.5 7.502c.26.274.5.632.5.998zM3.5 5a1.5 1.5.0 1 0 0-3 1.5 1.5.0 0 0 0 3z"/></svg><ul class=tags__list><li class=tags__item><a class="tags__link btn" href=/tags/augmented-reality/ rel=tag>Augmented Reality</a></li></ul></div></article></main><div class="authorbox clearfix"><figure class=authorbox__avatar><img alt="Anabela Marto avatar" src=/img/avatar.jpg class=avatar height=90 width=90></figure><div class=authorbox__header><span class=authorbox__name>About Anabela Marto</span></div><div class=authorbox__description>Anabela Marto is an Invited Lecturer in the Department of Informatics Engineering at the Superior School of Technology and Management (ESTG) - Polytechnic Institute of Leiria (IPLeiria) - and a Researcher at Computer Science and Communication Research Centre (CIIC), and at INESC TEC, Porto.
