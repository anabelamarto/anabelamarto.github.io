But how to do it? A study using a well known model called UTAUT was conducted to undertsand if this model would fit when augmented reality is suggested among archaeoloical sites.&lt;/p&gt;

But we, humans, perceive the world with different senses and in real-time.
Thus, multisensory approaches emerge to prize and enhance users&amp;rsquo; experiences. What stage has been reached these kind of applications?&lt;/p&gt;

among archaeological sites. Me and my colleague Alexandino Gonçalves were kindly invited by the archaeologist José Carlos Quaresma, back in 2017.
I felt in love with the cultural and nature richness of this archaeological site at first sight and I came back, over and over again.&lt;/p&gt;

I found myself surrounded
by the beauty and quietness of the river estuary, the richness of historical remnants from Roman Empire,
