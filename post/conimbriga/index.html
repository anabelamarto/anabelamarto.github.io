country&rsquo;s central and northern regions. It is classified as a National Monument.</p><p></p><p>Like many archaeological sites, Conimbriga was built in layers. Some of the earliest layers date back to the first
Iron Age in the 9th Century B.C.
The Romans arrived in the 2nd Century A.D., conquering the Celtic inhabitants and establishing a city that grew,
flourished, and then fell victim to barbarian invasions until Conimbriga&rsquo;s residents fled to nearby Coimbra in 468.</p><h2 id=the-city>The city</h2><p>Although Conimbriga wasn&rsquo;t the biggest Roman city in Portugal, it&rsquo;s the best preserved.
The city walls are largely intact, and the mosaic floors and foundations of many houses and public buildings remain.
In the baths, you can view the network of stone heating ducts beneath the now-missing floors.
Archaeologists estimate that only 10 percent of the city has been excavated, so you&rsquo;re likely to see new discoveries
if you return to Conimbriga after a previous visit.</p><p><img src=/img/placeholder.png alt="The house of Cantaber, Conimbriga"></p><p>The settlement at Conimbriga was first inhabited from the end of the second millennium BC during the Bronze and Iron
Age periods, through the Roman era when Portugal was the Roman province of Lusitania, until it was gradually abandoned
in the time of the invasions of Visigoths and later Swabians.</p><p>Only around 20% of the total historical, urban area has been excavated but the remains give a fascinating insight in to
the life and culture during the Roman occupation of Portugal.</p><h2 id=domus>Domus</h2><p>** The House of the Fountains **
Walking along the remains of a Roman road that once ran from Olisipo
(present-day Lisbon) to Braccara Augusta (Braga), the first place of major
interest at Conimbriga is the spectacular House of Fountains, first discovered in 1939 and
subsequently excavated over the following decades.</p><p><img src=/img/placeholder.png alt="The house of Cantaber, Conimbriga"></p><p>Protected from the elements on one side by a roof and wall, raised walkways give access to a huge
aristocratic Roman residence complete with central garden and fountains and superb mosaics. The House of Fountains
is believed to date from the Severan period (from 193-235) and the mosaics depict hunting scenes with dogs, Bacchus
(Dionysus) as well as the heroic cycles of Perseus and the Gorgon.</p><p>The house was demolished to make way for a protective wall built during the later stages of the imperial period as
the area came under attack from invading armies of Swabians.</p><p><strong>The House of Cantabar</strong></p><p>The remains of the &ldquo;House of Cantabar&rdquo; - which is believed to date from the Flavian era of 69-98 - reveal a grand,
aristocratic residence with around 40 rooms. Reconstructed pillars of the peristyles (an open colonnade) reveal what was
once the garden, the entrance and triclinium (formal dining room).</p><p><img src=/img/placeholder.png alt="The house of Cantaber, Conimbriga"></p><p>** The Baths of the Aqueduct **</p><p>The insula (apartment building) of the aqueduct was built on three floors with stone walls, lime mortar, tiled roofs and
sophisticated sewage systems. Again the building had to be redeveloped with the building of the defensive wall but at one time
it housed a large cold water pool (natatio), the main cold room (frigidarium) and small tepid (tepidarium) and warm (caldarium) rooms.
A 3km-long aqueduct once brought water to these baths.</p><h2 id=the-forum>The Forum</h2><p>The Forum was the center of life in any Roman city. Rebuilt concrete columns of the monumental portico give some idea of the
size of Conimbriga&rsquo;s forum which once housed a large temple dedicated to the imperial cult of Augustus and his successors.
Surrounding the forum are the remains of shops and dwellings, some of which pre-date the Roman period.</p><h2 id=the-south-baths>The South Baths</h2><p>The South baths were the largest baths in the city and date from the end of the first century. It was divided in three main areas: a large open
cold bath leading to what were once covered cold, warm and hot rooms. A large palaestra or courtyard accessed by stairs once
gave views over the surrounding countryside.</p><p><img src=/img/placeholder.png alt="The South Baths, Conimbriga"></p><h2 id=the-amphitheatre>The Amphitheatre</h2><p>Conimbriga once had a large amphitheatre measuring about 60mx90m which was demolished to provide building materials for the
defensive wall. Most of the remains of the amphitheatre are buried under the village of Condeixa-a-Velha.</p><p>Nowadays, this is still a space for some related events, such as &ldquo;A Lenda do Minotauro&rdquo; (the minotaur legend), a greek dance, performed by
Caryatids – Ancien Greek Dance Company, thank to Sara Toscano.</p><p><img src=/img/conimbriga/event.jpg alt="Amphiteatre, Conimbriga"></p><h2 id=the-wall>The Wall</h2><p>As the security situation deteriorated in the later part of the Roman era, a huge defensive wall measuring 6m in height and 3m
in width was built virtually cutting the city in two. The city&rsquo;s boundaries were shortened as the inhabitants withdrew to a smaller,
more defensible area. Parts of this huge undertaking are visible on site.</p><p><img src=/img/conimbriga/questionarios.jpg alt="The house of the Fountains, Conimbriga"></p><p>A total of 135 visitors from Miróbriga kindly participated in my study and contributed for a better understanding related to acceptance and intention to use augmented reality in archaeological sites.</p><h2 id=historical-review>Historical Review</h2><p>This article was reviewed by «designation + name + short bio».</p></div><div class="post__tags tags clearfix"><svg class="icon icon-tag" width="16" height="16" viewBox="0 0 16 16"><path d="M16 9.5c0 .373-.24.74-.5 1l-5 5c-.275.26-.634.5-1 .5-.373.0-.74-.24-1-.5L1 8a2.853 2.853.0 0 1-.7-1C.113 6.55.0 5.973.0 5.6V1.4C0 1.034.134.669.401.401.67.134 1.034.0 1.4.0h4.2c.373.0.95.113 1.4.3.45.187.732.432 1 .7l7.5 7.502c.26.274.5.632.5.998zM3.5 5a1.5 1.5.0 1 0 0-3 1.5 1.5.0 0 0 0 3z"/></svg><ul class=tags__list><li class=tags__item><a class="tags__link btn" href=/tags/cultural-heritage/ rel=tag>Cultural Heritage</a></li><li class=tags__item><a class="tags__link btn" href=/tags/acceptance-study/ rel=tag>Acceptance Study</a></li></ul></div></article></main><div class="authorbox clearfix"><figure class=authorbox__avatar><img alt="Anabela Marto avatar" src=/img/avatar.jpg class=avatar height=90 width=90></figure><div class=authorbox__header><span class=authorbox__name>About Anabela Marto</span></div><div class=authorbox__description>Anabela Marto is an Invited Lecturer in the Computer Engineering Department at the Superior School of Technology and Management (ESTG) - Polytechnic of Leiria (IPLeiria) - and a Researcher at Computer Science and Communication Research Centre (CIIC).
