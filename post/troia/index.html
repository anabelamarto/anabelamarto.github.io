I found myself surrounded

and the friendliness of the staff. What a pleasant stay! Let me tell you about this amazing archaeological site.</p><p></p><p>The Roman Ruins of Tróia were a large fish-salting production complex built in the first half of the 1<sup>st</sup> century AD and became
an urban-type settlement, composed by many fish-salting factories of different sizes.</p><h2 id=the-settlement>The settlement</h2><p>Situated on a narrow stretch of sand which would have been an island in Roman times, probably, the island of <em>Achale</em> (mentioned by the Latin
writer <em>Avenius</em>), this roman settlement is also composed by houses, a bath complex, several cemeteries,
a mausoleum and an early Christian basilica.</p><h2 id=fish-salting-workshops>Fish-salting workshops</h2><p>Profiting from the abundance of fish in the Atlantic and the outstanding salt production of the Sado estuary, it produced salted fish and fish sauces,
among which was the famous <em>garum</em>.</p><p><img src=/img/troia/troia.jpg alt="Workshops, Tróia"></p><p><strong>Fish-salting workshop 1</strong></p><p>Is the largest fish-salting workshop uncovered in Tróia and one of the largest in the Roman world.
The excavations, since 1950s, demonstrate that this workshop had at least two phases: one large space with tanks along the four walls and a large
central patio with a well (in the 1<sup>st</sup> and 2<sup>nd</sup> centuries), and smaller workshops that have been divided (in the 3<sup>rd</sup> century).</p><p><strong>Fish-salting workshop 2</strong></p><p>Smaller than workshop 1, it is believed that in its much smaller tanks, different products must have been prepared.
This workshop was also divided in the 3<sup>rd</sip> century AD into two smaller workshops.</p><h2 id=baths>Baths</h2><p>Certainly, belonging to the owner of the fish-salting factory, this bath complex ensured bathing facilities for the owners
as well as for foremen and workmen, freeman or slaves.</p><p>The heated area of the baths had a hot area (<em>caldarium</em>), next to a furnace (<em>praefurnium</em>) and a tepid room (<em>tepidarium</em>), giving way
to the cold area (<em>frigidarium</em>).</p><h2 id=mausoleum>Mausoleum</h2><p><img src=/img/troia/mausoleum.jpg alt="Mausoleum, Tróia"></p><p>According to the practice of cremation, typical of Roman culture, a mausoleum was built with niches on the walls for funerary urns.
At the end of the 2<sup>nd</sup> century AD, a new practice of inhumation was adopted and, on the ground, tombs were built for placing
corpses in graves.</p><p>On top of a dune made of sand and garbage which had accumulated behind the mausoleum, inhumations were buried in tombs constructed of brick and stone.
These tombs have a typical Christian orientation, heads to northwest and feet to southeast.</p><h2 id=my-experience>My experience</h2><p>I visited this wonderful space for two times: the first time because I wanted to include this archaeological space in my study;
the second, because I loved this place and I wanted to come back.</p><p>In my second visit there, a school was also visiting the space and they were playing this treasure hunt game, it seems to be very fun!
And it was so amusing watching these little kids so enthusiastic about decoding the clues related to the Roman times and conconquering
the final treasure: a delicious sauce fish, alluding to <em>garum</em>.</p><p><img src=/img/troia/troia_AM.jpg alt="questionnaires, Tróia"></p><p>A total of 34 visitors kindly participated in my study and contributed for a better understanding realted to acceptance and intention to use
augmented reality in archaeological sites.</p><h2 id=want-to-know-more>Want to know more?</h2><p>Roman Ruins of Tróia are worth your visit, for individual visitants, and also for schools with their fun and didactic school programs.
