In a total of 8 days, Conimbriga&amp;rsquo;s visitors were able to see more, to hear more, and to smell more. The house of Cantaber was augmented with a virtual reconstruction, a soundscape, and a smell of &lt;em&gt;garum&lt;/em&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

This data relates to the reconstruction of one part of the House of Cantaber, from Conimbriga.
This article shows what was reconstructed, and why.&lt;/p&gt;

Very well known among computer graphics community as a great opportunity to share, learn and explore the latest works and ideas, Eurographics 2019 edition was also the right event to find some interesting topics to bridge with SensiMAR prototype.&lt;/p&gt;

But how to do it? A study using a well known model called UTAUT was conducted to undertsand if this model would fit when augmented reality is suggested among archaeoloical sites.&lt;/p&gt;

But we, humans, perceive the world with different senses and in real-time.
Thus, multisensory approaches emerge to prize and enhance users&amp;rsquo; experiences. What stage has been reached these kind of applications?&lt;/p&gt;
