Very well known among computer graphics comunity as a great opportunity to share, learn and explore the latest works and ideas, Eurographics 2019 edition was also the right event to find some interesting topics to bridge with SensiMAR prototype.&lt;/p&gt;

But how to do it? A study using a well known model called UTAUT was conducted to undertsand if this model would fit when augmented reality is suggested among archaeoloical sites.&lt;/p&gt;

country&amp;rsquo;s central and northern regions. It is classified as a National Monument.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;With more than 100.000 visitors per year, the Roman ruins of Conimbriga are the most important archaeological site in Portugal.&lt;/p&gt;

But we, humans, perceive the world with different senses and in real-time.
Thus, multisensory approaches emerge to prize and enhance users&amp;rsquo; experiences. What stage has been reached these kind of applications?&lt;/p&gt;

among archaeological sites. Me and my colleague Alexandino Gonçalves were kindly invited by the archaeologist José Carlos Quaresma, back in 2017.
I felt in love with the cultural and nature richness of this archaeological site at first sight and I came back, over and over again.&lt;/p&gt;

I found myself surrounded
by the beauty and quietness of the river estuary, the richness of historical remnants from Roman Empire,
and the friendliness of the staff. What a pleasant stay! Let me tell you about this amazing archaeological site.&lt;/p&gt;

On the Northern region of the Country, this Monte Mozinho Hill Fort, also known as &lt;em&gt;Cidade Morta de Penfield&lt;/em&gt; (&amp;ldquo;dead town of Penafiel&amp;rdquo;),
is one of the great archaeological treasures in Portugal.&lt;/p&gt;
