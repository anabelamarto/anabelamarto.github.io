But we, humans, perceive the world with different senses and in real-time.
Thus, multisensory approaches emerge to prize and enhance users&amp;rsquo; experiences. What stage has been reached these kind of applications?&lt;/p&gt;

On the Northern region of the Country, this Monte Mozinho Hill Fort, also known as Cidade Morta de Penfield (&amp;ldquo;dead town of Penafiel&amp;rdquo;),

among archaeological sites. Me and my colleague Alexandino Gonçalves were kindly invited by the archaeologist José Carlos Quaresma, in 2017.
Back then, I felt in love with the cultural and nature richness of this archaeological site. So I came back, over and over again.&lt;/p&gt;
